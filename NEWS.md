# corteza 0.7.1.44

- **Context compaction now belongs to the shared agent lifecycle.** `turn()`
  checks the live context before a run and after each complete assistant/tool
  result batch, so direct callers cannot bypass it. A single long autonomous
  prompt can be split at a safe call/result boundary while retaining a recent
  token tail; Anthropic, OpenAI Chat, and Responses/Codex native histories are
  all pairing-aware. A real context-window overflow gets one compact-and-
  continue retry without inventing a user message, and usage from both attempts
  is retained. CLI and `chat()` manual/automatic compaction now use this same
  path and durably record summaries through a pre-rewrite lifecycle hook.
  Codex compaction omits unsupported sampling controls, and caught summarizer
  failures are exposed through a lifecycle hook instead of remaining silent.
- **Compaction briefs can be domain-specific.** `new_session(compaction_prompt = )`
  lets a long-running host state what evidence and working state its summary must
  preserve, while NULL retains corteza's existing coding-agent brief.
- **Context accounting understands Codex and provider products.** Responses
  output, function-call results, and opaque reasoning state are no longer
  reported as near-empty history. Context-window lookup can distinguish the
  public API's model limit from the smaller ChatGPT Codex working window.

- **Instruction skills are now compact, lazy, and session-scoped.** Startup
  discovers exact `SKILL.md` files recursively, puts only their names,
  one-line descriptions, and stable ids in the prompt, and exposes the
  read-only `skill_instructions` tool for exact body or relative-resource
  retrieval. Each CLI, console, Matrix room, and subagent owns an immutable
  hash snapshot; changed, foreign, traversal, and symlink-escaping resources
  are refused. Explicit `instruction_roots` merge by stable root id and
  `instruction_disabled` ids union across global and project config.
  Instruction documents remain separate from executable tools, and the
  legacy full-body `format_skill_docs()` contract remains available.

- **System context is now a provenance-carrying saber manifest.** Corteza
  requires saber 0.7.2.3 at its published commit, renders compact shared and
  project instructions through its manifest API, and retains the source
  metadata on CLI, `chat()`, and Matrix sessions. `/context` reports included
  and skipped sources, their token estimates, reasons, and paths/origins
  without exposing their bodies. The migration removes corteza's obsolete
  inlined `saber::agent_context()` fallback and the eager package-help layer
  that duplicated tool schemas at substantial token cost; package help remains
  available on demand. Claude-specific global instructions and basename-
  matched memory are no longer guessed implicitly—operators can add any such
  files explicitly through `context_files`.

- **`run_r` can now be capability-scoped without changing its default.**
  `tool_run_r(code, envir = ...)` accepts a caller-owned persistent R
  environment whose assignments and large-result handles remain private to
  that scope. Existing calls still evaluate in `globalenv()` and retain
  workspace auto-capture; the model-facing tool schema still exposes only
  `code`, so hosts—not models—select the execution boundary.

- **Limit failover now finishes interrupted tool runs without replaying
  completed tools.** Provider-native histories are bridged to portable text
  when the next candidate uses a different wire. Matrix configs also honor
  `reasoning_effort` and can set `fallback_primary_retry_at` (for example,
  `"Mon 03:00"`) so a limited primary is retried at its weekly reset while
  the fallback serves requests in the meantime. Every fallback reply now names
  the actual model/provider; crossing from subscription providers onto an
  API-key provider produces an intentionally loud billable-usage banner.

# corteza 0.7.1.43

- **Anthropic prompt caching is plumbed through.** `new_session(cache =
  "5m")` (or `"1h"`, or `"none"`) reaches `llm.api::agent(cache = )`,
  with `config$cache` as the fallback. Anthropic-only, and stripped for
  other providers -- per candidate during a fallback too -- so a codex
  session never carries it and llm.api's off-Anthropic warning stays
  meaningful. Validated as a closed set, because llm.api's `match.arg`
  would otherwise partial-match `"5"` to `"5m"` silently. Billing-only:
  the model sees byte-identical input, so this cannot change a result.
  With llm.api 0.1.9.6, now the Imports floor, the marker covers the
  message history as well as the system prompt, so each request in a
  tool loop reads the previous request's context from cache and pays
  fresh input only for what was appended since. The floor is raised
  because an older llm.api marks the system prompt alone and would
  silently deliver a fraction of that.

# corteza 0.7.1.42

- **`reasoning_effort` now works on Anthropic too.** Claude's depth
  control is `output_config.effort`, not the thinking budget, and its
  scale is `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, `"xhigh"`, `"max"` -- the API
  names it in the 400 when refused. Rather than add a second setting,
  `reasoning_effort` is routed to whichever field the provider's wire
  uses, so a session sets it once and it means the same thing on either
  family. Routing is symmetric, because a limit fallback re-routes per
  candidate and a one-hop-only value would silently vanish on the
  provider that answered. `thinking_budget_tokens` is unchanged and
  still Anthropic-only; the two are independent.

# corteza 0.7.1.41

- **A limit fallback no longer sends a provider a history it cannot
  read.** A conversation's history carries the content vocabulary of
  the wire that produced it, and llm.api replays what it is handed, so
  an Anthropic history diverted onto a Responses-wire fallback came
  back as `API error (400): Invalid value: 'thinking'` -- and since a
  400 is not a limit error, that ended the turn instead of continuing
  down the chain. A Matrix bot on `anthropic_claude` hit this the
  moment an Anthropic usage limit sent it to its `openai_codex`
  fallback mid-conversation. Candidates whose wire cannot replay the
  history's shape are now skipped (with a message), so the walk reaches
  one that can.
- **Reasoning depth is now a session setting.** `new_session()` takes
  `reasoning_effort` (`"low"`/`"medium"`/`"high"`, forwarded on the
  `openai` and `openai_codex` wires) and `thinking_budget_tokens`
  (Anthropic extended thinking). Both resolve session-field-then-config
  like `max_tokens`, so `reasoning_effort` or `thinking_budget_tokens`
  in `.corteza/config.json` reaches the CLI, `chat()`, and Matrix
  surfaces without further wiring. Each is dropped for providers whose
  wire cannot carry it -- including after a limit fallback rewrites the
  provider, where an effort setting meant for codex would otherwise
  reach the Anthropic Messages body as an unknown field and 400.

# corteza 0.7.1.40

- **Harness hardening** (review follow-up to the previous release).
  A project `.corteza/harness.json` travels with a cloned repo, so it
  is third-party data: entries are validated as they load, and
  project lessons render in a separate "Untrusted project notes"
  block that tells the model to treat them as reference material and
  never as instructions, unless the project is trusted via
  `harness_trust_project` in the *global* config. Rollback is now a
  compare-and-swap that refuses when an entry changed after the
  refinement being reverted, instead of silently destroying the later
  edit. Store writes use a unique temp file, check `file.rename()`,
  and hold a lock across the whole read-modify-write so concurrent
  sessions can't discard each other's entries. `/refine` shows
  evidence, kind, and path with each proposed edit and enforces the
  8-edit maximum in code.
- **`harness_auto`**: config flag for recording lessons without
  prompting (implemented as the default for the `harness_note`
  permission, so there is one enforcement path; explicit permissions
  still win). Auto-recorded notes remain in the ledger and reversible.
- Fixed: the in-process tool executor passed no `cwd`, so
  `harness_note` wrote to the process working directory instead of
  the session's project. Found by the new end-to-end approval tests.

# corteza 0.7.1.39

- **Continual harness**: a self-improving store of one-line lessons
  the agent records as it works and that ride into every later
  session's context. `harness_note(title, fact, evidence)` is a tool
  the model calls the moment it verifies a durable fact (approval-
  gated by default); `/refine` reviews the conversation into proposed
  edits shown one at a time for approval, with `/refine list`,
  `/refine rollback <id>`, and `/refine promote <id>`. Entries carry
  ids, versions, provenance, and evidence; every applied edit records
  before/after snapshots so rollback is a generated inverse; the base
  system prompt is never in the store. Project scope lives in
  `.corteza/harness.json`, global in the user data dir. Injection is
  the whole store while small (empty store adds nothing to context).

# corteza 0.7.1.38

- **`new_session()` gains `max_tokens`**: a per-response output-token
  budget forwarded to `llm.api::agent` (NULL defers to
  `config$max_tokens`, then llm.api's provider default — 4096 on
  Anthropic). Agent turns that write long tool calls, big `run_r`
  bodies especially, need more than that default: a response the
  budget cuts off ends the turn with `[Output truncated: max_tokens]`
  (llm.api#39) instead of the model's answer. Resolution follows the
  `web_search`/`base_url` idiom via `.session_max_tokens()`; both
  boundaries validate (single positive whole number — `as.integer()`
  alone would truncate fractions and pass NA through). Requires
  llm.api >= 0.1.9.5: forwarding a budget onto an older llm.api walks
  straight into the silent-truncation bug #39 fixes.

# corteza 0.7.1.37

- **Auto runs write a record of authority**: one append-only JSONL per
  run under `agents/<agent>/auto/<run_id>.jsonl`. `run_start` is
  written before validation (a refused start still appears), each gate
  consultation gets a record naming the deciding authority (budget /
  envelope / monitor / accounting) — envelope-refused calls previously
  left no trace anywhere — each monitor progress verdict is recorded,
  and `run_end` carries a mechanical stop category, spend, executed
  calls, and the worktree delta. A file with no `run_end` is a run
  whose process died. The `auto_run_id` also stamps main-session trace
  entries written during the run and the monitor's transcript header,
  so the three surfaces join; attended formats are unchanged.

# corteza 0.7.1.36

- **`turn()` falls back to other providers on limit errors.** A new
  `fallback` config key (Matrix config and `.corteza/config.json`; a
  `bot_configure()` argument) lists `"model provider"` pairs to try when
  the primary answers with HTTP 429/503/529 or a rate, usage, or quota
  message. The provider that tripped is skipped process-wide for
  `fallback_cooldown_minutes` (default 30), then the primary is tried
  again. A limit hit after tool calls have run is not retried, so no
  tool call executes twice. Other errors pass through unchanged.

# corteza 0.7.1.35

- **`/auto [--loops N] <goal>` runs bounded unattended iterations**,
  supervised by a read-only "hall monitor" subagent. The monitor is the
  point: `turn()` routes only `"ask"` verdicts to `approval_cb`, and the
  default tensor resolves ordinary project writes to `"allow"` outside
  `~/projects`, so a supervisor wired there would never be consulted for
  the edits that matter. Every call surviving `policy()` now passes a
  `session$auto_gate` instead, whatever the verdict.
- **The monitor's authority is mechanically bounded** before it is asked
  anything: credential-path safety verdicts, paths escaping the project
  (resolved through symlinks), unknown tools, and write calls whose
  target cannot be resolved all stop for a human rather than going to a
  model for an opinion. Project config can tighten the envelope but
  never widen it, since a `.corteza/config.json` travels with a cloned
  repo. Shell and R execution is off unless enabled per run with
  `--exec` or in your own global config, because those tools' effects
  cannot be resolved from their arguments.
- Budgets are enforced at the gate, immediately before each brokered
  call and again after each monitor query, not merely between turns: one
  turn makes many calls, and asking the monitor costs tokens of its own.
  Errors and interrupts end a run rather than continuing against the
  previous turn's reply.
- **Subagent presets can now withhold provider-native web search and
  confine file tools to the project.** `subagent_turn_init()` previously
  built its session without a `web_search` argument, so every subagent
  had server-side search on regardless of its tool preset.
- Auto-run progress is measured by content hash rather than size and
  mtime, against a baseline that keeps pre-existing uncommitted work out
  of the run's ledger; spend counts the monitor's own queries, and an
  unpriced model stops the run rather than counting as zero.

# corteza 0.7.1.34

- **`/permissions` switches approval mode for the session**
  (`/permissions allow|ask|deny`), instead of only printing settings.
  Changing how much corteza asks before running a tool previously meant
  editing `config.json` and restarting. Session-scoped like `/dryrun`;
  the reply names the config file for anyone who wants it permanent,
  and says plainly that `allow` does not waive the credential-path
  guard, which short-circuits ahead of the config overlay.

# corteza 0.7.1.33

- **Follows the grpc package's rename to rgrpc** (their #27, same
  `grpc_*` function surface): Suggests, namespace qualifiers, the
  runtime floor (rgrpc >= 0.1.0, the first release under the new
  name), and the refusal messages.

# corteza 0.7.1.32

- **The verifier dials the agent's own homeserver directly.** When a
  voice caller names the agent's own homeserver domain (the domain of
  the bot's `user_id`), OpenID verification goes straight to the
  configured `server` URL instead of through Matrix discovery — a
  tailnet homeserver is deliberately not publicly discoverable. Every
  other server name still discovers normally, and the bypass changes
  only where the question is asked: the sub-domain binding and
  membership check are untouched. Derived entirely from the bot
  config; no hostname constant in code or config. Replaces the
  hostname-rewriting shadow in the launch script.

# corteza 0.7.1.31

- **Voice turns generate in spoken register.** A voice session's
  system prompt now carries an instruction to write plain speakable
  prose: no markdown syntax, numbers and abbreviations said aloud,
  short sentences, visual content described in words. The reply is
  synthesized verbatim by contract (the client may not alter it, or
  the heard-text accounting breaks), so speakable text has to be born
  speakable — the first live run read a markdown table aloud as
  "asterisk five bend forward". `voice.speech_style` in the config
  replaces the instruction's text; typed room chat keeps markdown.

# corteza 0.7.1.30

- **The allocator caller speaks the settled `gpu-voice-alloc/1`
  contract.** The request body carries the protocol version, and every
  mint presents the service credential from the new
  `voice.allocator_token` config key (a configured allocator without
  its token refuses with a named config error). The response envelope
  (`ok`, `v`, `allocation_id`, `room_id`) is validated before the
  grant is read, a refusal's `error` sentence is surfaced, a 401 is
  reported as the config problem it is, and the allocation id is
  logged so log lines and revocation can name the grant.

# corteza 0.7.1.29

- **A barge-in stops the generation, not just the stream.** When the
  voice client hangs up on a Converse stream mid-reply, the delta
  relay now calls `llm.api::llm_cancel()`: the provider stops
  generating and the turn returns its partial reply immediately,
  instead of running out a tail nobody is listening to. The voice
  server is single-threaded, so that tail was exactly the delay before
  the user's next turn could start -- and it billed for every token.
  The room record still keeps everything generated up to the cut.

# corteza 0.7.1.28

- **corteza serves live voice.** `voice_serve()` runs the AgentVoice
  gRPC service a fluffychat live-voice client talks to: `AllocateVoice`
  verifies the caller's Matrix OpenID token against their own
  homeserver, checks room membership, and relays a media grant from the
  fleet allocator (`voice.allocator`, HTTP); `Converse` runs one turn
  through the shared `turn()` machinery, streaming text deltas as the
  model produces them; `ReportTurn` cuts the stored room message down
  to the prefix the user actually heard, counted in code points. The
  reply is posted when generation ends and edited down on report, so a
  session that dies unreported leaves the full text standing -- the
  documented fallback. Audio never crosses corteza: the client streams
  PCM to the model hosts directly. Runs as its own R process, next to
  the room poll loop, and needs the `grpc` and `RProtoBuf` Suggests.
  The contract is `inst/proto/cornball/agent/v1/agent_voice.proto`,
  vendored from cornball-ai/fluffychat.

# corteza 0.7.1.27

- **A config can name the transport.** `cfg$transport` picks the client
  constructor behind `bot_chat_client()`: absent or `"matrix"` is the
  Matrix adapter as before; a `{"constructor": "pkg::fn", "args": {...}}`
  list builds any other `chat.api` client, and the whole room loop runs
  on it. The adapter must hold its own poll cursor and report
  `first_run`; the existing guard now says so.

# corteza 0.7.1.26

- **A segment room is not named after the command that ended it.**
  The fork auto-prepends a bare `/clear` as its own message, so a
  conversation opening with one produced a permanent room titled
  `/clear (2026-08-20)`. Commands are skipped when picking the title.

- **A conversation the user said nothing in gets no room.** A `/clear`
  straight after a `/clear` archives fine and used to become a sidebar
  entry that will never be worth reopening. The bar is "said anything at
  all", not a turn count -- a threshold would be a number nobody chose.

# corteza 0.7.1.25

- **The per-image ceiling is per provider.** It was one 5 MB constant,
  taken from Anthropic's documented limit on the reasoning that the
  strictest provider is the safe one to assume. That refused the first
  real photograph anyone sent -- 5.58 MB, 6.5% over -- to a bot running
  gpt-5.5, which takes four times that. Anthropic keeps 5 MB, OpenAI
  and `openai_codex` get 20 MB, and a provider that is not listed takes
  the conservative default rather than a guess. `image_max_bytes` still
  overrides all of it. The "skipping" message now names the limit as
  well as the size, since a line saying a picture was refused without
  saying what would have passed is the one thing a reader has to go
  find out.

# corteza 0.7.1.24

- **A picture posted in a room reaches the model as a picture.** An
  image arrives as its own message carrying an attachment that names
  where the bytes live; corteza fetches it through the transport
  (`chat.api::chat_download()`), encodes it, and sends it alongside the
  text as `llm.api::llm_content()`. Before this the bot saw only the
  filename, and answered that no image was attached.

  On by default for the cloud providers, off for `ollama` (a local
  build is as likely to be a text-only 9b as a vision model). Both are
  overridable with `images: true`/`false` in the Matrix config, and
  `image_max_bytes` sets the per-image ceiling (5 MB by default). One
  unfetchable picture -- an encrypted attachment, most likely -- costs
  the message its image and nothing else. Requires chat.api >= 0.0.1.24
  and an llm.api with `llm_content()`; without either, the text goes
  through as it did before and a message on stderr says why.

# corteza 0.7.1.23

- **A folded conversation continues from its thread.** Sessions are
  keyed by room and thread root rather than room alone, so a room's
  main timeline and each of its threads are separate conversations
  (without a thread the key is the room id exactly, so existing rooms
  are unaffected). The first message in a thread seeds its session from
  the archive the thread stands for, found through the
  `ai.cornball.fold` index the fold writes into the topic room. Replies
  go back into the thread they answer, falling back to the room where
  the transport cannot route one. Requires chat.api >= 0.0.1.23.

# corteza 0.7.1.22

- **A cleared conversation can become a room of its own.** When a
  cleared room is listed in the config's `segment_rooms`, `/clear`
  files the ended conversation as a "segment": a private room named by
  the conversation's opening line, carrying the archived-transcript
  pointer as a notice and an `ai.cornball.lifecycle` state event that
  clients group and demote by. Off unless configured. Requires
  chat.api >= 0.0.1.22 (`chat_set_state()`); older transports skip
  with a message.

# corteza 0.7.1.19

- **`matrix_*` is now `bot_*`, and `R/matrix.R` is `R/rooms.R`.** corteza
  reaches every transport through the `chat.api` contract and makes no
  `mx.api` or `mx.client` call of its own, so the prefix named a coupling
  that no longer exists. Of the 74 functions renamed, roughly 20 were ever
  transport; the rest are agent behaviour that had been wearing a Matrix
  prefix since the day it was written.

  The eight exported names stay as wrappers that warn and forward:
  `matrix_configure`, `matrix_send`, `matrix_poll`, `matrix_run`,
  `matrix_run_init`, `matrix_run_step`, `matrix_archive_all`,
  `matrix_request_flush`. Nothing about behaviour differs. They are
  scheduled for removal at 1.0.0.

- **Message records use the contract's field names**: `room_id` is
  `channel`, `event_id` is `id`, matching `chat.api::chat_message()`.
  `cfg$room_id` is unchanged -- it is a key in a JSON file on disk, and
  renaming it would be a config migration rather than a rename.

# corteza 0.7.1.18

- **The last `mx.*` calls are gone.** Credentials and current-state reads
  go through `chat.api`: `chat_matrix_config()`, `chat_config_save()`,
  `chat_matrix_configure()` and `chat_set_identity()` for the credential
  lifecycle, `chat_channels()`, `chat_history()`, `chat_pending()` and
  `chat_mark_read()` for the state the poll cursor cannot answer.

  The startup invite catch-up was the last raw sync, and it was raw
  precisely because an invitation is standing state that a cursor cannot
  deliver. `chat_pending()` is the verb for it.

  `mx.api` leaves Suggests, and `matrix_require_mx()` checks `chat.api`
  alone: repeating a downstream package's own requirements is asserting
  facts only that package can keep true. `mx.client` stays in Suggests
  because the integration tests stub it to drive a real relogin through
  the whole stack.

- **`chat_poll()` no longer returns `$client`.** corteza used to take the
  post-sync config out of it and rebuild a client per send, because a
  `/model` rename could rotate the access token and the config file the
  two shared was the only thing keeping them in step.
  `chat_set_identity()` leaves the rotation on the client that performed
  it, so there is one client for the poll and every send after it.

# corteza 0.7.1.15

- **Invitations ride the transport contract, and `res$raw` goes unread.**
  The poll loop reads `chat_poll()$invites` and joins with `chat_join()`.
  That was the last thing it took off the raw sync response, so the
  migration's stated finish line is reached: every message, decrypted
  message, reaction and invitation now arrives as a record.

  `matrix_invite_inviters()` is deleted. Reading who sent an invitation
  meant walking the stripped `invite_state`, which put Matrix sync-shape
  knowledge two packages away from the sync; `mx.client` owns it now and
  the record carries it.

  The operator gate is unchanged in behaviour and clearer in reporting: an
  invitation from someone not on the list and one whose sender the
  homeserver never named both refuse, and now say which is which.

  One invite that cannot be joined no longer risks the others. `chat_join()`
  raises so each failure is visible, and `matrix_accept_invites()` catches
  per room so a revoked invitation cannot take the whole poll with it.

  The startup catch-up still reads a raw sync. It needs a full no-since
  sync to see invitations issued while the bot was down, and `chat_poll()`
  only ever resumes from a cursor -- so it stays until the contract grows
  a verb for that. It goes through the same gate, so the operator policy
  is written once.

  Requires `chat.api >= 0.0.1.14` and `mx.client >= 0.2.0.4`.

# corteza 0.7.1.14

- **Room metadata rides the transport contract.** `mx_room_name()`,
  `mx_room_topic()` and `mx_room_members()` are gone from the Matrix
  loop, replaced by `chat_channel_info()` and `chat_members()`. Three of
  the nine remaining direct mx.api calls go with them.

  `matrix_new_session()` made three state reads and fetched the topic
  twice: once inside `matrix_room_cwd()` for the working directory, and
  again for the room description. It makes one now, and
  `matrix_room_cwd()` takes the topic rather than fetching one.

  `matrix_archive_session()`, `matrix_archive_all()` and
  `matrix_handle_flush_signal()` take a `chat` client where they took an
  `mx_sess`; `matrix_room_members_cached()` likewise. `matrix_archive_all()`
  is exported, so that is a signature change.

  A failed member lookup still keeps the previous cache rather than
  emptying it. `chat_members()` raises instead of returning `character()`
  precisely so the two can be told apart -- an empty room and an
  unanswerable question are different, and only one of them means the
  room emptied.

  Also drops the unused `mx_sess` parameter from
  `matrix_default_system()`, which no caller passed.

  Requires `chat.api >= 0.0.1.13`, enforced at runtime.

# corteza 0.7.1.13

- **Reaction approval rides the transport contract.**
  `matrix_reaction_approval()` no longer calls `mx.api::mx_react()` or
  runs its own private `mx_sync` loop; it uses `chat_react()` and
  `chat_poll()$reactions`. Two of the four direct mx.api sites are gone
  with it. The approve/deny vocabulary stays in corteza, where the prompt
  that teaches a user which emoji to tap also lives, and is now
  overridable per config via `approve_keys` / `deny_keys`.

  Three bugs fixed on the way:

  - **Approvals outside the default room could only time out.** The
    prompt went to the session's room but the verdict was read from
    `cfg$room_id`, so in every room but one no tap was ever seen.
  - **The fastest tap was the one most likely to be lost.** The baseline
    cursor was taken *after* the prompt was sent, so a reaction placed in
    between landed in the baseline sync and was discarded with it. The
    baseline is taken first now; nothing can react to an event that does
    not exist yet.
  - The poll loop runs on a client built `save_cursor = FALSE`, so its
    private cursor cannot be written over the bot's own position. This
    was not reachable before -- the old loop drove `mx_sync` directly and
    never touched the stored token -- but it becomes possible the moment
    the loop goes through `chat_poll()`, and it is the failure that would
    have silently eaten every message sent while a user was deciding.

  `mx_extract_reaction_verdict()`'s corteza wrapper is deleted: it
  delegated the approve/deny vocabulary to the transport package.

  Requires `chat.api >= 0.0.1.12` and `mx.client >= 0.2.0.3`, both
  enforced at runtime.

# corteza 0.7.1.12

- **End-to-end encryption moves into the chat.api Matrix adapter.**
  `R/matrix_crypto.R` is gone and `mx.crypto` has left Suggests.
  corteza no longer builds an Olm account, carries Megolm sessions,
  tracks which rooms are encrypted, or keeps a second send path for
  encrypted rooms. Setting `e2ee` in the Matrix config now enables
  encryption in the adapter, which encrypts and decrypts on both sides
  of `chat_poll()` / `chat_send()`; decrypted messages arrive in
  `chat_poll()$messages` like any other traffic, so the poll loop stops
  reading `m.room.encrypted` out of the raw sync. `matrix_poll()` drops
  its `crypto` argument and `matrix_run_init()` no longer returns a
  crypto context. Requires `chat.api >= 0.0.1.9`, enforced at runtime.

  corteza names no crypto store. The adapter derives one per Matrix
  device, `(user_id, device_id)`, and records that identity in the store
  so another device cannot open it. This replaces
  `dirname(config)/crypto`, which tied the device identity to wherever
  the config file sat, so a moved config silently minted a new device and
  lost every Megolm session with it.

- **`mx.client` floor raised to 0.2.0.2.** That release stops
  `mx_send_encrypted()` reporting success for a message nobody can
  read: it filters its own device by `(user_id, device_id)` rather than
  `device_id` alone, refuses to post when every recipient device was
  skipped, and treats a partial `/keys/query` or `/keys/claim` as
  unanswered rather than as a user with no devices. corteza does not
  call it directly, but every encrypted reply this loop sends goes
  through it.

- **CI installs and version-checks the Matrix stack.** It is all
  Suggests, and `_R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=false` let a run pass without
  any of it -- which it did, silently, because every Matrix test sits
  behind a `requireNamespace()` guard that skips the whole integration
  file. The workflow now installs `mx.api`, `mx.client`, and `chat.api`
  from source and fails if either declared floor is unmet, so the
  transport tests cannot skip themselves into a green tick.

# corteza 0.7.1.4

- **`Additional_repositories` declares the cornball drat.** `chat.api`
  is a Suggests and is not on CRAN, so CRAN could not resolve it and
  the check NOTE listed it with no availability line -- which blocked a
  release. It is now published at
  <https://cornball-ai.github.io/drat/> and declared here, so the NOTE
  reports `chat.api yes` against the declared repository, the form
  Writing R Extensions describes for exactly this case.

# corteza 0.7.1.3

- **Model badge fixes.** A display-name relogin left the caller holding
  the rejected token, so the next `/model` acknowledgement was dropped
  silently; `matrix_update_displayname()` now returns the refreshed
  config. Startup and `/clear` advertised `cfg$model` rather than the
  runtime override the next session is built with. The
  `mx.client >= 0.2.0` floor is now enforced at runtime, not only
  declared, so a stale installed copy fails loudly instead of losing
  the rename to a best-effort `tryCatch`.

# corteza 0.7.1.2

- **Opt-in Matrix model badge.** New `matrix_configure(model_badge =)`
  key: `"never"` (default, unchanged behavior), `"non_default"`, or
  `"always"`. When a badge applies, deterministic post-turn code — not
  the model — prepends a `⚡ <model> (<provider>)` first line to each
  reply and renames the bot to `<name> ⚡ <model>`, so a room session
  that `/model`-switched to a paid provider is visible on every message
  and in the sender line. In `"non_default"` mode silence means the
  configured default: the badge appears only while a switch is live and
  disappears on `/clear` or a process restart (both reset the profile
  name too). The display name is account-global, so with sessions in
  several rooms the most recent switch wins; the per-reply badge line
  is always room-accurate. `display_name` optionally sets the base name
  the rename builds on (default: the user-id localpart).
  The profile update goes through the new mx.client
  `mx_set_displayname()` (>= 0.2.0), which refreshes a rotated token
  instead of silently failing the rename.

# corteza 0.7.1.1

- **The Matrix message plane rides the chat.api transport contract.**
  Sends, receives, and the typing indicator go through `chat_send()`,
  `chat_poll()`, and `chat_typing()` instead of calling mx.client and
  mx.api directly. Encrypted rooms stay on the mx.crypto path, and
  corteza still reads invites, reactions, and encrypted events off the
  raw sync response itself. `chat.api` is a Suggests, gated by the same
  check as the rest of the Matrix stack, so it is only needed on hosts
  that enable the channel.

# corteza 0.7.1

## New

- **`openai_compatible` provider for generic OpenAI-compatible
  endpoints** (#149). Point corteza at OpenRouter, DeepSeek, DeepInfra,
  a local proxy, or a corporate gateway via a `base_url` config key or
  the `--base-url` CLI flag (falling back to
  `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL`). The model id is passed through
  untouched and is required; the API key comes from
  `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and a keyless
  gateway works with neither. A missing endpoint or model is reported
  at session setup rather than at the first request. `turn()` applies
  the endpoint through `llm.api::llm_base()` scoped to each agent call,
  so a mid-session `/provider` switch or a subagent on another provider
  cannot inherit it. Requires `llm.api >= 0.1.9`. See
  `vignette("configuration")`.

- **Provider-native web search.** The agent loop enables
  `llm.api::agent()`'s server-side web search for the hosted providers
  that support it (`anthropic`, `anthropic_claude`, `openai`,
  `openai_codex`, `moonshot`). On by default, no Tavily key required;
  the model searches inside its own turn. Toggle with `--web-search` /
  `--no-web-search`, `chat(web_search = )`, or a `web_search` key in
  `.corteza/config.json`. The Tavily `web_search` tool remains the
  fallback for local models.

- **Matrix `/model` lists available models and switches by number.**
  Bare `/model` (or `//model` where the client eats single slashes)
  replies with a numbered menu instead of echoing the current settings:
  the configured default, the live local Ollama inventory, and any
  hosted models declared via the new `matrix_configure(models =)` key
  (`"model provider"` strings, since hosted providers cannot be
  enumerated remotely). `/model 3` switches the room session to entry
  3, setting model and provider together, so switching from a phone
  client never needs a typed model name. The typed form
  `/model <name> [provider]` is unchanged, and an unreachable Ollama
  degrades the menu to the configured entries.

## Matrix access control

- **Private conversations and invites are restricted to configured
  operators.** The new `operators` key lists the Matrix ids allowed a
  one-on-one conversation with the bot. A room with one human is
  answered only when that human is an operator; everyone else gets
  silence rather than a mention-gated session. Invites are gated on the
  same list, read from the inviter in the stripped `invite_state`, and
  an invite whose inviter cannot be determined is refused. Group rooms
  are unaffected. Leaving `operators` unset preserves the previous
  behavior.

- **Reply gating counts humans, not members.** Rooms whose only non-bot
  member is one human are answered without a mention; rooms with two or
  more humans require a mention (replies count, since clients put the
  replied-to user in `m.mentions`) or an open engagement window: after
  the bot answers someone, that person's plain messages keep getting
  replies for 5 minutes, ending early when they address someone else.
  Other bot accounts are declared via the new `matrix_configure(bots =)`
  parameter; their messages always require a mention. Room membership is
  cached per session and refreshed on unknown senders or every 10
  minutes, replacing the boot-time DM snapshot that left rooms stuck on
  stale gating after membership changed. With `bots` unset, behavior
  matches the old member-count rule minus the staleness; during a
  members-API outage the gate fails open for human senders instead of
  going silent.

## Matrix fixes

- **Non-triggering messages are ingested instead of dropped.** In a room
  with more than one human, a message that did not warrant a reply was
  marked seen, given a read receipt, then dropped with a bare `next`:
  never appended to the session's history and, because it was already
  marked seen, never reconsidered. The agent genuinely never saw other
  people's non-mention messages in a busy room, even though it had
  "read" them. Gated messages are now appended to history as context;
  the reply gate and its bot-loop protection are unchanged, only
  ingestion is. Turns are attributed with a `[sender]` prefix in rooms
  with more than one human (both the live poll and the startup
  backfill), and known bot senders are labeled even in one-human rooms,
  so the model can tell speakers apart. A lone-human DM is unchanged.

- **Rooms load project context into the room system prompt.**
  `matrix_new_session()` passed a non-NULL `system` to `session_setup()`
  with `load_project_context = FALSE`, so Matrix bots ran without the
  project briefing, agent context files, `.corteza` `context_files`, and
  package tool docs that other channels receive. The new
  `matrix_room_system()` composes the Matrix identity header with
  `load_context()` for the room cwd.

## Archiving

- **Archives are built from a Matrix-visible event ledger, not from
  provider history.** History holds tool calls and tool results that
  were never Matrix events, so a restarted process (which rebuilds
  history from the server's visible messages) could not align with what
  it had archived, and tool-using rooms re-archived their whole backfill
  on every restart. Sessions keep a transcript of
  `{event_id, role, content}` and a queue of pending events, written
  where events are seen or sent and drained once archived. Archival keys
  on Matrix event ids, recognized against a bounded per-room tail of
  already-archived ids. Transcripts no longer contain tool turns.

- **Archive progress is persisted per room instead of tracked in
  memory.** `matrix_archive_session()` used `ingested_through`, an index
  into the in-memory session history, which reset on every restart while
  startup backfill refilled history from the server. Each restart
  therefore re-archived the backfilled tail. Progress is now an ordered
  key tail persisted per room under `CORTEZA_STATE_DIR`, advanced only
  after a successful ingest, so a failed archive retries rather than
  loses turns.

- **Archives are keyed by room id, not display name.** Room display
  names and avatars are mutable Matrix state, so archived transcripts
  use the global Matrix room id for `title` and `source`. The room name
  is retained only as archive-time metadata, which keeps renames from
  splitting one chat into multiple raw archive identities.

# corteza 0.7.0

CRAN release consolidating the 0.6.9.1-0.6.9.8 development cycle plus a
runtime-hardening batch. Last CRAN release: 0.6.9. Per-cycle detail follows.

## Highlights since 0.6.9

- **Matrix loop split** into `matrix_run_init()` / `matrix_run_step()`, with
  the channel delegating session and transport plumbing to `mx.client`.
- **`anthropic_claude` provider** (Claude on a subscription via OAuth),
  requiring llm.api (>= 0.1.8).
- **Tool-timeout hardening.** bash/cmd/run_r/run_r_script and the network
  tools (`fetch_url`/`web_search`, now bounded by curl's own timeout) are no
  longer wrapped in an R-level `setTimeLimit`; the residual flush moved to
  `skill_run` entry so a validation/dry-run early return can't leak a queued
  interrupt (#142, #139).
- **Narration guard.** Every tool outcome (executed, denied, declined,
  dry-run, task) routes through one nudge finalizer; the streak resets at
  each agent-run boundary.
- **Approval-prompt hardening.** Model-controlled fields rendered into the
  approval prompt and the model-visible history (paths, tool names, args,
  policy reasons) are sanitized so a crafted value can't forge a prompt line.
  Untrusted Matrix room metadata is sanitized and framed as informational in
  the system prompt.
- **`/compact` survives provider-native history** (Anthropic, OpenAI chat, and
  role-less OpenAI Codex Responses entries), including tool calls and outputs.

# corteza 0.6.9.8

## Changes

- `/compact` now renders Anthropic, OpenAI chat, and role-less OpenAI Codex
  Responses history safely, including tool calls and tool outputs. This prevents
  provider-native history entries from wedging compaction.

- Matrix documentation now matches the `anthropic_claude` provider default and
  documents the optional `crypto` polling context.

# corteza 0.6.9.7

## Changes

- Accept the `anthropic_claude` provider, which drives Claude on a Claude
  subscription (OAuth) via llm.api instead of an API key. Added to
  `matrix_configure()`'s provider whitelist and routed through the Anthropic
  message shape for interrupt-time tool-result repair. Requires llm.api
  (>= 0.1.4.3).

# corteza 0.6.9.6

## Changes

- The Matrix long-poll loop is split into two new exports,
  `matrix_run_init()` (build the session registry, catch up on invites,
  backfill history, init E2EE) and `matrix_run_step(state, timeout)` (one
  poll-and-reply iteration). `matrix_run()` is now a thin wrapper over
  them. Lets an external scheduler own the main process and interleave
  the Matrix poll with its own work. No behavior change for
  `matrix_run()`.

# corteza 0.6.9.5

## Changes

- Matrix channel now delegates config persistence, session construction,
  message sending, sync/cursor handling, relogin, and encrypted-room
  detection to the `mx.client` package instead of hand-rolled plumbing
  over `mx.api`. Behavior is unchanged; ~37 fewer lines in the adapter.

# corteza 0.6.9.1

## Changes

- The system prompt now includes a runtime-guidance block describing the
  live, persistent R session, `run_r`/`run_r_script` semantics, and that
  the bash tool makes corteza a general-purpose agent rather than R-only.

# corteza 0.6.9

## Fix: scope all three `tools::R_user_dir()` roots to tempdir under R CMD check

PR #96 already redirected `R_USER_CACHE_DIR` for the test run (so
saber's transitive briefs writes landed in tempdir), but corteza
itself writes to all three `tools::R_user_dir()` roots — `cache`
(saber briefs, `/last` response), `data` (session transcripts via
`R/paths.R`, matrix state), and `config` (matrix.json). Session tests
were still leaking files under
`~/.local/share/R/corteza/agents/…/sessions/*.jsonl`, which would
have tripped CRAN's "checking for new files in some other
directories" NOTE on BDR's `donttest` box even when local
`tinypkgr::check()` reports `Status: OK`. The suite-level redirect in
`tests/tinytest.R` now sets all three (`R_USER_CACHE_DIR`,
`R_USER_DATA_DIR`, `R_USER_CONFIG_DIR`) to tempfiles for the check
run; end-user behavior is unchanged.

# corteza 0.6.8

Patch release batching the 0.6.7.1 through 0.6.7.12 dev cycles. Per-PR
detail is preserved in the dev-marker sections below.

# corteza 0.6.7.12

## Fix: spawned subagents inherit the parent session's provider/model

`chat(provider = "ollama")` followed by an LLM-triggered
`spawn_subagent` was silently producing children on Anthropic: the
default `tool_executor` in `.make_tool_handler()` called `call_skill()`
with no `ctx`, so `tool_spawn_subagent()` saw `ctx$session = NULL` and
`subagent_spawn()` fell through to `getOption("corteza.provider")`. The
executor now passes `ctx = list(session = session)`, so provider, model,
`cwd`, `plan_mode`, and `archival_depth` all flow through to the child.

# corteza 0.6.7.11

## Fix: cap tool output before it reaches model context

A single unbounded tool result (e.g. a `bash` command that printed 57k
lines) was flattened straight to the model and mirrored into history,
blowing the next call past the provider token limit; `/compact` then
couldn't recover the session. Tool results now pass through a universal
guard (`admit_tool_result()`) that caps oversized output to a marker plus
a recoverable handle, and `/compact` elides giant message bodies so it can
rescue an already-wedged session.

# corteza 0.6.7.10

## Fix: `chat()` crash on a model-less session

A `chat()` started without an explicit `model` no longer crashes after
the first turn. The per-turn context meter called
`context_limit_for_model()` with a NULL model and errored on the table
subscript; it now falls back to the default limit (and resolves a
model-less session to the provider default for display).

# corteza 0.6.7.9

## CRAN pre-submission housekeeping

Packaging-only pass ahead of the 0.6.8 release: applied a deferred
rformat reflow, generated the `user_interrupt_marker` man page,
refreshed `cran-comments.md`, and turned the skills vignette's clone
example into a `<your-skills-repo-url>` placeholder so it carries no
dead link. No code behavior changes.

# corteza 0.6.7.8

## Interrupt marker matches the deny marker's directive

A turn interrupted with Ctrl+C / Esc now leaves the same "stop and ask
the user what to do instead" instruction in history as an explicit
deny, so the LLM checks in on the next turn rather than quietly
continuing. Previously the interrupt marker was terser than the deny
marker even though the approval prompt's Esc/Ctrl+C hint routes through
the interrupt path.

# corteza 0.6.7.7

## Provider default models come from llm.api

`default_provider_model()` now delegates to
`llm.api::provider_default_model()` instead of corteza's own
provider-to-model table, which had drifted. corteza tracks llm.api's
picks going forward (e.g. `openai` and `moonshot` defaults shift to
llm.api's current choices). No change when you set a model explicitly.

# corteza 0.6.7.6

## MCP subagent exposure is opt-in, with a spend cap

`serve()` no longer hands the subagent tools (`spawn_subagent`,
`query_subagent`, `collect_subagent`, `list_subagents`, `kill_subagent`)
to MCP clients by default. A spawned subagent runs its own agent loop
and spends autonomously on the host's LLM credentials, so an unattended
MCP client could otherwise trigger unbounded cost it never sees.

Enable with `subagents.expose_over_mcp` (config, default FALSE) or
`serve(expose_subagents = TRUE)`. When enabled, cumulative subagent
spend over MCP is capped: `spawn_subagent`/`query_subagent` are refused
once spend crosses `subagents.mcp_spend_cap_usd` (default $5.00; `<= 0`
disables) or an optional `subagents.mcp_spend_cap_tokens` for providers
that don't report cost. The cap reads the same meter as `/spent`; the
in-process `chat()`/CLI loop is unaffected.

# corteza 0.6.7.5

## /spent: approximate session cost

`/spent` (alias `/cost`) reports the approximate USD spent this process
run, in both `chat()` and the CLI. Each turn accumulates the `cost`
scalar that llm.api 0.1.4 returns, plus token counts. When a model is
absent from llm.api's price snapshot its cost is unknown, so totals are
shown as a floor rather than a precise figure.

Spend is process-lifetime: `/clear` no longer zeroes the tally, it
closes the current conversation and opens a new one, so `/spent`
itemizes each conversation between clears with a grand total. `/clear`
now also kills any live subagents (a fresh conversation leaves none
behind); their spend is retired into the run total, shown as a separate
process-level subagents line that keeps counting an agent after it is
killed. Resumed prior-run spend is not loaded from disk.

# corteza 0.6.7.4

## CLI and chat() share one in-process REPL loop

The CLI no longer runs tools in a separate `callr` worker. `chat()` and
the CLI now drive one shared loop (`run_repl_loop`) in a single R
process, executing tools in-process via `corteza::turn()`.

* **One subagent registry.** Model-driven and slash-driven subagents
  previously lived in separate registries (worker vs main process) and
  were mutually invisible in CLI mode. They now share one
  `.subagent_registry` per session: a model-spawned subagent shows up in
  `/agents`, and a `/spawn`-ed one is reachable by `query_subagent`.
* **One command set.** Both surfaces run the same slash commands; `/flush`
  moved into the shared loop. Per-surface differences (rendering, help
  text, input reader) ride through injected hooks, not forked logic.
* `chat()` gains the per-turn context meter and auto-compaction the CLI
  already had.
* The local-eval ops (`/r`, `!`) and the foreground `bash` tool moved off
  blocking `system2()` onto interruptible `processx::run()`, so an
  interrupt returns to the prompt instead of killing the session.
* Removed the CLI worker transport and its four exports
  (`worker_dispatch`, `worker_tool_list`, `cli_worker_spawn`,
  `cli_worker_drain_events`). `worker_init()` stays exported: subagents
  call it across the `callr::r_session` boundary to set cwd and register
  skills.

# corteza 0.6.7.3

## Interrupt / denial preserves context across the exit

Hitting Ctrl+C (CLI) or Esc (RStudio chat) after a multi-tool turn
no longer loses the tool calls that completed before the interrupt.
Previously the next turn / next CLI invocation saw the original
user prompt, an interrupt marker, and nothing else.

* `Imports: llm.api (>= 0.1.4)` so `agent()` exposes the
  `history_callback` parameter. `R/turn.R` uses it to mirror the
  in-progress provider-native history into the live session env as
  each assistant message and each tool result lands. With the
  callback wired, `turn_session$history` reflects the latest snapshot
  even when an interrupt unwinds the turn mid-flight.
* New helper `repair_interrupted_tool_history()` (with the
  surrounding `apply_exit_marker()`) synthesizes provider-correct
  tool_result blocks for any tool_use issued during the current
  turn that never got matching results. Wired into chat()'s
  `interrupt` and `corteza_user_deny` condition handlers. Anthropic's
  "every tool_use needs a tool_result" requirement no longer 400s
  the next chat() API call after an interrupted multi-tool turn.
* New helper `dump_completed_tools_summary()` walks the per-turn
  history slice and appends a text summary of completed tool calls
  to the persistent flat-text `session$messages` before the
  interrupt / denial marker. Wired into both CLI exit handlers
  (`inst/bin/corteza`). The next CLI turn's `api_history` rebuild
  now carries the work the LLM accomplished before the interrupt
  ("[ran tool_name(...) -> result]" entries instead of nothing).
* Two-layer `on.exit` guard around the archival ownership transfer.
  An inner guard inside `archival_archive_turn()` kills the holder
  subagent if anything between spawn and the explicit
  `transferred <- TRUE` unwinds; an outer guard in
  `maybe_archive_turn()` covers the parent-history-collapse window.
  Either failure cleans the orphan instead of leaving it sitting in
  `.subagent_registry` with no parent reference.

# corteza 0.6.7.2

## Subagents can return a value by handle

* `subagent_query()` / the `query_subagent` tool gain a `return_name`
  argument. When set to a name (or `.h_NNN` handle) the child left its
  result bound under, the child resolves it after the turn and ships
  the value back; the parent stashes it in the handle store and
  appends a `[stored as .h_NNN]` block to the reply. A large
  structured result is then referenced by name in a later `run_r`
  instead of being inlined into the parent's context, mirroring how
  `run_r` already returns large values. The async (`wait = FALSE`)
  path captures the name at query time and applies it on collect.
* The name is validated as a single syntactic name or handle and
  resolved (handle store, then globalenv) without evaluating
  expressions; an unresolved or malformed name yields a clear note
  rather than silently dropping the value.

# corteza 0.6.7.1

## Base-R cleanups from a redundancy audit

* `skill_install()` clones GitHub repos via `processx::run()`
  (already an import) instead of `system2()`, with a nonzero git
  exit surfaced as a clear error. The clone is extracted into an
  internal `git_clone()` helper so its status handling is
  unit-testable against a local repository, no network required.
* `find_break_point()` (text chunking) replaces two backward
  character-scan loops with a two-tier regex: last newline, else
  last whitespace (tabs included). Behavior preserved; added
  regression tests for newline-beats-later-space and tab handling.

# corteza 0.6.7

Patch release batching the 0.6.6.1 through 0.6.6.20 dev cycles plus
the out-of-band "Deny aborts the whole turn" change. Per-PR detail
is preserved in the dev-marker sections below.

## RStudio addin: multi-line statements

* `corteza_execute_in_chat()` / `_retain()` now expand the current
  line to the full top-level R statement before sending, matching
  RStudio's built-in Ctrl+Enter behavior. Before, hitting Ctrl+Enter
  on the first line of `lm(y ~ x,\n   data = df)` sent only the
  unclosed first line -- annoying outside `chat()`, and broken
  inside `chat()` where `/r lm(y ~ x,` failed to parse. Buffer is
  parsed with `keep.source = TRUE`; falls back to single-line when
  the buffer has a syntax error elsewhere or the cursor sits on a
  blank / comment line outside any expression.
* `chat()` and the CLI `/r` handlers now read continuation lines
  with a `+` prompt until the expression parses, mirroring R's
  built-in REPL continuation. Capped at 100 continuation lines to
  keep a stuck parse from blocking the REPL.

# corteza 0.6.6.20

## Codex review for #110 + #111

* **Handle staleness (medium).** `handle_eval_env()` used to skip
  reassignment when the `.h_NNN` symbol already existed in
  globalenv, so rebinding a handle id in the store left the old
  globalenv copy in place (codex repro'd: `tool_run_r('.h_001')`
  returned the previous snapshot after the store was rewritten).
  Now `handle_eval_env()` assigns unconditionally and removes
  globalenv bindings the package previously created that are no
  longer in the store, via a new `.handle_managed` registry.
  `clear_handles()` also sweeps the managed bindings out of
  globalenv.
* **Session-name collisions across agents (medium/low).**
  `session_id()` ignored its caller's agent and only collision-
  checked the default agent's transcript dir. With the
  docker-style ~6000-name pool, a non-main agent could mint a
  name that already existed in its own store and silently reuse
  the transcript. `session_id()` now takes `agent_id`, threads
  it to `.session_name_exists()`, and the collision check now
  consults both the transcript file *and* the in-store metadata
  for that agent.
* **Untitled buffers in the RStudio addin (low).** Unsaved
  source-editor buffers return empty `ctx$path`, so
  `tools::file_ext()` returned `""` and the addin routed the
  line as "other" -- inside chat() that meant the LLM saw raw
  R code instead of a `/r ...` invocation. Untitled buffers are
  now treated as R, matching RStudio's built-in assumption.

# corteza 0.6.6.19

## RStudio addin: route Ctrl+Enter to /r or ! when chat() is active

* New addin `corteza_execute_in_chat()` (plus
  `corteza_execute_in_chat_retain()` for Alt+Enter) reads the
  current line / selection from RStudio's source editor and sends
  it to the console, auto-prefixing `/r ` for `.R` files and
  `! ` for `.sh` / `.bash` files when `corteza::chat()` is the
  active REPL. When `chat()` is not running, no prefix is added --
  the addin is a superset of RStudio's default execute-line
  behavior, so binding it to Ctrl+Enter doesn't break normal R
  scripting outside chat.
* `chat()` now sets `options(corteza.chat_active = TRUE)` on entry
  and clears it on exit; the addin reads this flag to decide
  whether to prefix.
* `rstudioapi` added to Suggests. Addin file lives at
  `inst/rstudio/addins.dcf` so RStudio picks it up after install.

**Setup:** in RStudio, open Tools -> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts,
pick "Addins" in the dropdown, and bind Ctrl+Enter (and optionally
Alt+Enter) to the two corteza addins. Override the built-in
"Run current line/selection" mappings.

# corteza 0.6.6.18

## Fix: tool_run_r now actually persists `<-` assignments

* `tool_run_r()` was advertised as "Execute R code in the session's
  global environment", but PR #36 (Phase 5 of CLI/worker split,
  2026-04-21) silently changed it to evaluate in a fresh child env
  of globalenv. Ordinary `<-` and `=` assignments landed in the
  child env and disappeared when the call returned; only `<<-`
  walked up the scope chain and persisted. Reported 2026-05-20.
* `handle_eval_env()` now copies handles INTO globalenv (under
  their hidden `.h_NNN` names that `ls()` filters out by default)
  and returns globalenv itself. `tool_run_r()` evals in globalenv,
  so `<-` writes the the right place and survives between calls.
* Regression tests in `test_tool_impl.R` and `test_handles.R`
  exercise multi-call persistence with both `<-` and `=`.

# corteza 0.6.6.17

## Brain-corn brick banner + docker-style session names

* Banner kernels are now actual yellow-square emoji (`U+1F7E8`)
  laid out in a brick pattern: adjacent rows offset by an odd
  number of cells so the kernels stagger like masonry instead of
  stacking in straight columns. No ANSI escapes -- the emoji is
  its own colour, supported across every modern terminal.
* Model name is now right-padded to 9 chars, provider
  left-padded to 8 chars, so row-5 width stays constant
  regardless of name length. Without this, swapping
  `kimi-k2.6` for `gpt-4o` shifted the right edge and broke the
  brick offset.
* Version display drops the 4th-component dev marker:
  `0.6.6.17` -> `v0.6.6`.
* Tool count moved out of the banner -- the brain stays cleaner
  with just the model/provider labels.
* Session names are now docker-style `adjective_surname`
  (e.g. `boring_wozniak`) instead of UUIDs. Wordlists are the
  Docker moby/moby adjectives plus ~60 scientist surnames.
  Collisions retry up to 10 times before falling back to a hex
  suffix.

## CLI startup layout

* "Starting worker..." and "Connected. N tools available." now
  print on one combined line instead of two stacked lines.
* The blank line that previously sat between the worker line and
  the banner is gone; the banner appears one line below the
  startup line, with a single blank between them.
* `corteza::chat()` now prints a `session adjective_surname`
  line below the banner, matching the CLI's layout.

# corteza 0.6.6.16

## Brain-corn startup banner

* `chat()` and the `~/bin/corteza` CLI now open with a gold
  brain-corn silhouette rendered in 256-color ANSI, with the
  corteza version, active model, provider, tool count, and
  `/help` / `/quit` hints embedded directly inside the kernels.
  Replaces the prior single-line `corteza chat | model @ provider`
  header. Uses 256-color index 220 (gold) for compatibility with
  terminals that don't advertise true-color via `COLORTERM`.
* New internal `corteza_startup_banner()` in `R/banner.R` --
  template-driven, so future tweaks to the silhouette only touch
  one constant.

# corteza 0.6.6.15

## `! <cmd>` shell-line in chat() and CLI

* New `! <cmd>` prompt prefix runs a shell command locally (bash on
  unix, cmd.exe on Windows), prints output, and stages it for the
  next LLM message. Matches the Claude Code / codex `!` convention.
  The space after `!` is required so prompts that legitimately
  start with `!` aren't captured. Output is capped at 4000
  characters in the staged version (with a truncation note); the
  on-screen output is full.
* `/r <expr>` is now available in the CLI too -- previously chat()
  only. Same staging behavior: visible result prints inline, gets
  queued for the next LLM message, with an oversized printed
  result swapped for `str()` of the value.
* Shared helpers `run_bang_shell()` and `run_r_eval()` live in
  `R/chat-slash.R` so both surfaces use one source of truth for
  the local-eval + cap logic.

# corteza 0.6.6.14

## Persistent task list the LLM maintains across turns

* New internal `task_create(tasks)` / `task_update(index, status)`
  LLM tools (Claude-Code-style TaskCreate pattern). The list lives
  on the session, is injected into each turn's system prompt as
  numbered `[ ] / [>] / [x] / [-]` lines, and is shown to the user
  as a compact summary whenever it changes during a turn. Status
  is `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, or `cancelled`.
  Promoting a task to `in_progress` auto-demotes any other
  `in_progress` task to `pending` so the "one active at a time"
  invariant holds without rejecting valid edits.
* Tools dispatched via an in-process intercept in
  `.make_tool_handler()` (`R/turn.R`) rather than the normal skill
  executor, so the CLI's callr-worker dispatch can't strand
  mutations in the wrong process. The intercept fires before
  dry-run, policy, and approval -- task-list updates never prompt
  the user.
* `/tasks` (and `/tasks clear`) slash commands in both `chat()`
  and the terminal CLI. `/clear` wipes the task list along with
  the conversation, matching the "fresh start" intent.
* Persistence: task list is saved as part of the session record
  (`session_new`, `session_save`, `session_load`) so it survives
  CLI restarts and `chat(session = ...)` resumes.
* Distinct from `/plan` mode, which is a one-shot
  research-and-propose flow; the task list tracks ongoing
  progress for multi-step work without changing the policy gate.

# corteza 0.6.6.13

## chat() banner resolves provider default model

* When `model` is NULL, `corteza::chat()`'s startup banner and
  per-turn "Thinking with ..." line route through
  `resolve_provider_model(provider, model)` instead of falling
  straight to the literal "(provider default)" placeholder. With
  `config$provider = "moonshot"` and no explicit `model`, the
  banner now reads `kimi-k2.6 @ moonshot`, matching what the
  terminal CLI already showed. Unknown providers still degrade to
  the "(provider default)" string.

# corteza 0.6.6.12

## Approval-prompt deny advertises the surface-appropriate
## interrupt key

* `cli_approval_lines()` takes a new `deny_label` argument (default
  `"Deny"`). `corteza::chat()` passes `"Deny (Esc)"`; the terminal
  CLI passes `"Deny (Ctrl+C)"`. The key doesn't literally cancel
  the readline prompt itself, but it cancels the in-flight turn,
  which is the user-facing escape hatch users want to know about.
  Deny still raises the `corteza_user_deny` marker; Esc/Ctrl+C
  during a turn raises an interrupt marker. The LLM treats both as
  "stop and check with the user" -- the wording of the interrupt
  marker is less directive than the deny marker, worth tightening
  in a follow-up.

# corteza 0.6.6.11

## Markdown rendering for chat() responses

* New `R/render-md-ansi.R` adds `render_md_ansi(text)` (internal):
  strip markdown syntax markers and apply ANSI styling for terminal
  display, leaving the raw markdown source intact when the output
  isn't a TTY (NO_COLOR, piped to file) or when the user opts out
  via `options(corteza.markdown = FALSE)`. Both `corteza::chat()`
  and `inst/bin/corteza` now route assistant responses through it,
  so the two surfaces stay in sync. Replaces the smaller bespoke
  renderer that previously lived in `inst/bin/corteza`. Handles
  H1/H2/H3 headings, `**bold**`, `*italic*` / `_italic_` (modern
  terminals interpret as italic), `` `inline code` ``, fenced code
  blocks (dim, 2-space indent), `- ` / `* ` bullets, `> blockquote`
  lines, and `[text](url)` links.

## Deny aborts the whole turn

* Picking "3. Deny" at the tool-approval prompt now aborts the
  entire turn instead of declining a single tool call. Previously
  the deny was returned as a `[user declined: ...]` tool result that
  the LLM saw and treated as feedback, planning the next call --
  which forced users to mash "3" through cascades of dependent tool
  calls. The next turn now starts with a history marker that names
  the denied tool and tells the LLM to stop and ask the user what to
  do instead, rather than retrying or planning a workaround.

# corteza 0.6.6.10

## /copy command in chat()

* New `/copy` slash command copies the most recent assistant
  response to the system clipboard via the optional `clipr`
  package. Silent no-op until the first assistant reply lands;
  prints a hint if `clipr` is not installed or the clipboard
  isn't available (e.g., headless Linux without xclip /
  wl-clipboard).

# corteza 0.6.6.9

## tool_run_r_script dodges callr Windows hang

* `tool_run_r_script()` switches its `callr::rscript()` call from
  `stdout = "|"` to `stdout = NULL`, with `stderr = "2>&1"`
  unchanged. The old combination hangs indefinitely on Windows with
  CRAN callr 3.7.6 when the child script errors via `stop()` — the
  internal `timeout` never fires (r-lib/callr#313). `res$stdout` is
  still populated by the `2>&1` redirect, so the return value and
  LLM-facing text are identical. Can be reverted once we depend on a
  fixed callr (>= the post-`e93efd1` release).
* `test_subagent_callr.R` gate rationale corrected: that gate is
  about per-test budget, not the callr bug; `r_session` uses a
  separate code path and was empirically verified not affected.

# corteza 0.6.6.8

## Tool-count parity between chat() and CLI

* `skills_as_api_tools()` (the chat() path) now applies the same
  `available()` predicate filter that `schema_from_registry()` (the
  CLI path) has always used. Conditional tools — `git_*` when not
  inside a repo, platform-specific shell tools — no longer show up
  in chat() while being hidden in the CLI. Counts agree.

## Per-turn timing footer spans the terminal

* `turn_footer_line()` defaults to the detected terminal width
  (`COLUMNS` env, `options("width")`) instead of a fixed 60-char
  line, so the `─ Worked for 3m 18s ────` separator reaches the
  right edge.

## /context and /status are one command

* `/status` is now an alias of `/context`. Both render the same
  block: a Codex-style header (corteza version, model+provider,
  cwd, session id) followed by the context meter.
* The meter now segments by component — `system` in bright blue,
  `tools` in bright magenta, `history` in cyan — so the bar maps
  visually to the breakdown rows below.
* Empty cells take the threshold color (yellow / orange / red) once
  usage crosses the warn line so saturation reads at a glance
  before any single segment dominates.

# corteza 0.6.6.7

## /context shows a real meter

* New compact horizontal `/context` display answers the two questions
  a user actually has: how full is context, and what's using it. Same
  in both `corteza::chat()` and the CLI:

  ```
  Context  24.7K / 128.0K  19%  compact 90%
  [██████████..................................│.....]
    system    22.0K  89%
    tools      2.7K  11%
    history      56
  ```

  - Filled cells color-grade through normal / warn / high / crit
    thresholds (defaults 75/90/95) as usage climbs.
  - The auto-compact threshold shows as a subtle `│` tick at its
    cell position in the empty part of the bar.
  - Breakdown rows are right-aligned percentages of the *used* total;
    rows under 1% drop the percent to avoid "0%" noise.
* Dropped the "Project context still comes from saber::briefing() and
  saber::agent_context()..." paragraph — the bar already shows where
  the system budget is going, and the prose was longer than the data.

# corteza 0.6.6.6

## Per-turn timing footer

* After each `corteza::chat()` or `~/bin/corteza` turn, a dim
  footer line shows wall-clock duration: `─ Worked for 3m 18s ────`.
* Fires on success, interrupt (Esc / Ctrl+C), and error. Useful
  data point in the exact moments you wanted to know how long
  something ran before you bailed.
* Static-at-end, not a live ticking counter. A live counter while
  R is blocked on the LLM HTTP call would need async polling in
  llm.api or a background process; both are real concurrency
  surfaces worth their own design pass.

# corteza 0.6.6.5

## Slash-command parity between chat() and the CLI

* Display/info helpers used to live in `inst/bin/corteza` only, so
  `corteza::chat()` couldn't render the same `/status`, `/doctor`,
  `/config`, `/diff`, or `/review` output. They now live in
  `R/cli-helpers.R` as internal package functions; both surfaces call
  them. chat() gets all five commands plus `/last` and `/outputs`.
* `/compact` in chat() now uses the same `do_compact()` the CLI does,
  instead of a separate inline implementation. Both routes share one
  prompt and one chat-call shape.
* Tool output buffer (`/last`, `/outputs`) is now session-scoped via
  `session$sessionId` rather than a CLI-process global. Subagents and
  parents have isolated buffers; `/clear` drops the outgoing
  session's buffer.

## Dead commands removed

* `/remember` and `/recall` in the CLI are gone. They called
  `memory_store` / `memory_search` / `strip_tags` / `parse_tags` —
  none of which exist in the package — and would error on use.
  `/flush` is alive (rebuilt earlier this cycle as a real memory
  flush via `.run_memory_flush()`) and stays.

# corteza 0.6.6.4

## Input handling

* Backspace past the start of your typing no longer eats the `> `
  prompt character. The bash hack used for line editing now passes
  the prompt to `read -e -p` so readline owns the cursor instead of
  the prompt being a `cat()` that readline can't see. ANSI color
  escapes in the prompt are wrapped in `\001 \002` so readline's
  column math stays correct.
* The approval prompt's `Choice [1]: ` dropped the `[1]` shell
  convention; the `(Enter)` hint already lives on choice 1 itself,
  so the bracket was redundant.
* Multi-line input in both `corteza::chat()` and the CLI. Two
  entries with two contracts:
  - `/paste [optional text]` — explicit "paste anything" mode.
    Collects every line verbatim (logs, code, paths with literal
    trailing `\`, etc.) until `/end` on its own line or Ctrl+D.
  - Any non-slash line ending with an unescaped `\` — drops into
    bash-heredoc-with-continuation mode mid-line, seeded with what
    you already typed. Keep ending lines with `\` to continue;
    the first line without a trailing `\` is final and gets
    included. `\\` at end of a line stays literal. `/end` and EOF
    also terminate.

  Paste content that happens to start with `/` is not reinterpreted
  as a corteza command. No "Paste mode..." banner — IYKYK.

# corteza 0.6.6.3

## Approval prompt

* The tool-approval prompt is much tighter. The `Reason` section
  (gate text + `Policy:` + `Model route:`) is gone; `Access` collapses
  to a single line that names the path or command (e.g. `Write to
  CLAUDE.md`, `Run command in /home/troy/corteza`); the redundant
  `Path:` detail line above `Access` is suppressed when it would just
  repeat the same path. Choices 1 and 3 carry key hints: `(Enter)` and
  `(Esc)`.
* Boilerplate warnings ("Shell commands can invoke scripts...",
  "R code runs locally...") no longer appear on every bash / run_r
  prompt. Noteworthy warnings — credential paths, paths outside the
  project — still surface.
* After the user answers, both surfaces print a single-line
  `● User replied:` summary paraphrasing the chosen action (e.g.
  "Allow writing to CLAUDE.md once").
* In the terminal CLI, the approval block is erased and replaced by
  the `User replied:` summary via ANSI cursor-up + clear-down. In
  `corteza::chat()` running under RStudio (whose console doesn't
  honor cursor-position escapes) the block stays in scrollback with
  the summary appended below.

# corteza 0.6.6.2

## Inline diffs on file edits

* `replace_in_file` and `write_file` now attach a unified-diff payload
  to their MCP result. The CLI and `corteza::chat()` render it inline
  in the tool-call output as `⎿ Added N, removed M` followed by one
  row per kept line (`NNNN +|-| content` with red/green color) instead
  of the prior `N lines in Xms` summary. The LLM-facing result text is
  unchanged — the diff is for the human reading the terminal.
* Tool labels renamed for clarity: `replace_in_file` → "Update",
  `write_file` → "Write" (matches the inline-diff phrasing).
* Diff generation shells out to the system `diff -u`. If `diff` isn't
  on `PATH` the tool degrades to a one-line size summary rather than
  failing. Diff payload is capped at 200 lines / 20000 chars with a
  `[diff truncated: N more lines]` marker so big writes don't dump
  thousands of lines into chat scrollback.
* The `/diff` slash command's output is also ANSI-colored.

## Console color policy is shared

* `ansi_supported()` / `ansi_colors()` in the package are now the
  single source of truth for both `corteza::chat()` and the
  `~/bin/corteza` CLI. RStudio's R console (which is not a tty) is now
  correctly detected as ANSI-capable, and `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR`
  overrides work in both surfaces.

# corteza 0.6.6.1

## Interrupt key

* Pressing the interrupt key during an in-flight agent turn now aborts
  the turn cleanly and returns control to the prompt instead of
  escaping the REPL entirely. Both `corteza::chat()` and the
  `~/bin/corteza` CLI catch the R-level interrupt.
* In the CLI, if the interrupt arrives while a tool call is running
  inside the `callr` worker subprocess, the worker is sent SIGINT so
  the in-flight tool (e.g. a long `bash` or `run_r` call) actually
  stops. The worker is recycled only if it doesn't return to idle.
* The aborted exchange is recorded in history with an
  `[Interrupted by user before completing.]` marker so the next turn's
  model sees that the prior turn ended early.
* Interrupt keys differ by environment: in the RStudio console
  `corteza::chat()` is interrupted by **Esc** (RStudio's console
  intercepts Ctrl+C for copy). In the terminal `~/bin/corteza` CLI it's
  **Ctrl+C** — terminals send raw `^[` for Esc, which is not a signal.

## Other

* `load_saber_briefing()` now wraps `saber::briefing()` in
  `suppressMessages()` so the briefing text no longer leaks to the
  user's terminal every time a subagent calls `session_setup()`.

# corteza 0.6.6

## Async subagent queries

* `subagent_query(id, prompt, wait = FALSE)` fires a prompt and
  returns the canonical id immediately; the parent collects the
  reply later with `subagent_collect(id)`. A subagent can carry
  only one in-flight async query at a time — both wait paths
  refuse to stack on top of a pending call.
* CLI gains `/queue <id> <prompt>` (fire) and `/collect <id>`
  (drain). `/agents` distinguishes idle vs busy.
* New MCP tool `collect_subagent` mirrors the CLI surface.

## Durable subagent transcripts

* Each working subagent now writes an append-only JSONL transcript
  at `agents/subagent-<id>/sessions/<id>.jsonl`, matching the
  shape archival holders already use. Disk space is cheap; context
  is expensive. Compaction (below) can rewrite the in-memory
  history without losing anything on disk.

## Context-budget helpers

* Token-counting helpers moved out of `inst/bin/corteza` into
  package code so chat, the CLI loop, and subagents share the
  same budget math: `context_limit_for_model()`, `format_tokens()`,
  `estimate_text_tokens()`, `estimate_history_tokens()`,
  `estimate_tool_tokens()`, `estimate_live_context_tokens()`,
  `context_usage_pct()`. Also `default_provider_model()` for
  resolving the model identity a subagent will actually run with.

## Subagent context compaction

* New `subagents.context_compaction` config block. Defaults to
  `mode: inherit_strict` with `compact_pct: 75`. Working subagents
  compact their own in-memory history after each turn when usage
  passes the threshold; the on-disk transcript stays intact.
  Archive holders are skipped via a kind marker stamped by
  `subagent_seed_history()`.

## Token visibility in /agents

* `/agents` now shows model, age, live context (tokens / limit),
  cumulative input/output tokens, and cumulative cost per
  subagent. Live tokens are computed via a child-side
  `r_session$run()` call per `/agents` invocation; busy children
  show `ctx ?`. Cost is captured when the provider returns it;
  shown as `?` otherwise (most non-Anthropic providers).

# corteza 0.6.5.1 (development)

## Plan mode

* New session-scoped `plan_mode` flag. When on, the LLM is told to
  research and propose rather than act: the policy engine denies
  write/exec tool calls (`write_file`, `replace_in_file`, `bash`,
  `run_r`, `run_r_script`), and an `exit_plan_mode` tool is injected
  into the tool list. A successful `exit_plan_mode` call flips the
  flag back off so the LLM proceeds with the work.
* `/plan` slash command in `chat()` and the `corteza` CLI: bare
  toggles, `/plan <task>` enables and submits the task as the next
  prompt.
* Subagents inherit `plan_mode` from `parent_session` so spawning a
  child can't launder a write through plan mode.

## Retroactive-extraction runtime (opt-in)

* New `archival` config block. Default off — CRAN users see no behavior
  change. When enabled, finished turns collapse into a fresh subagent
  that holds the full transcript, while the parent's history keeps a
  compact `{summary, subagent_id}` block. The LLM sees live subagents
  in its system prompt and picks `query_subagent` vs `spawn_subagent`
  as a normal tool decision.
* `[Max turns reached]` is no longer a dead-end string: with archival
  on, the full transcript persists in a subagent for follow-up via
  `query_subagent`.
* Recursion supported: subagents finishing their own queries
  re-evaluate triggers and archive into sub-subagents. Capped at depth
  3 by default (`archival.trigger.depth_cap`).
* Subagent transcripts persist to disk via the existing
  `transcript_append` infra under
  `agents/subagent-<id>/sessions/<id>.jsonl`.
* New internal helpers: `subagent_seed_history`, `subagent_turn_set_id`.
* Startup validation: `archival.enabled` requires `subagents.enabled`.
  No silent overrides.
* See `vignette("retroactive-extraction")` for the full opt-in
  surface, design notes, and known limitations.

## CLI

* `/spawn` now parses `--model`, `--preset`, and `--tools` in any
  order. Matches the MCP `tool_spawn_subagent` surface.

## Subagents

* Configurable subagent presets (`investigate`, `work`, `minimal`).
  Default is `investigate` (read/search only).
* `subagent_spawn(tools = character(0))` is now a documented
  configuration: spawns a holder with no active tools. Used by the
  archival runtime to create transcript-only subagents.
* `resolve_subagent_tools()` honors `config$subagents$default_tools`
  when neither preset nor tools is supplied (was silently bypassed
  before).

## MCP

* Fix MCP stdio transport compatibility with Claude Code: read from
  `file("stdin")` rather than `stdin()` (which reads from the script
  source under `Rscript -e`), echo the client's `protocolVersion` in
  the `initialize` response instead of hardcoding it, and serialize
  empty `capabilities.tools` as a JSON object (`{}`) rather than an
  array (`[]`). Thanks to Grant McDermott (@grantmcdermott, #62).

## Documentation

* New `configuration` vignette covering config files and precedence,
  CLI flags, the full JSON config-key surface (core, context, safety,
  skills, subagents, channels, etc.), slash commands, MCP server setup
  (stdio and socket transports), session tuning, systemd service, and
  environment variables. Thanks to Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr, #54).

# corteza 0.6.2

## CLI

* The `Live context` indicator now reflects the actual size of the next
  prompt (system + tools + message history) rather than cumulative
  billed API tokens. Old behavior counted up forever — `/clear` and
  `/compact` had no visible effect on the indicator. Status line label
  updated from `Usage` to `Live context`.
* `/context` now prints live usage and the auto-compact threshold
  alongside the loaded context files.
* Auto-compact threshold raised from 80% to 90%. Pairs with the
  estimate above to avoid over-eager compaction now that the metric is
  more accurate.
* Provider/model defaults centralized in `resolve_provider_model()`.
  Legacy `kimi-k2` now resolves to `kimi-k2.6` for moonshot.
  Moonshot's chat temperature is forced to 1 (their API rejects other
  values on kimi).
* Session field renamed: `session$compactions` ->
  `session$compactionCount`, matching `memoryFlushCompactionCount`.
  Existing on-disk sessions show 0 compactions until the next compact;
  display-only.

## CLI prompt input

* `_read_prompt_via_bash` now prints the prompt from R and captures
  input through a tempfile. Previously relied on `bash -p` plus
  `system2(stdout = TRUE)`, which was fragile on terminals that mixed
  the prompt into stdout.

# corteza 0.6.1

* Relicensed from MIT to Apache License (>= 2) for explicit patent
  grant. Aligns with the rest of the cornball.ai toolchain (saber,
  pensar, hacer). The LICENSE stub file is removed; Apache 2.0
  R-package convention points to the system-installed template.

# corteza 0.6.0

First CRAN submission.

## Architecture: CLI / worker split

Eight-phase refactor of the command-line interface so its subprocess
no longer speaks MCP internally.

* The CLI now drives a private `callr::r_session` worker. Tool
  dispatch goes through `corteza::worker_dispatch()` directly; no
  JSON-RPC, no `tools/list` handshake, no per-call envelope on the
  CLI-to-worker path.
* `serve()` remains a spec-compliant MCP server for external clients
  (Claude Desktop, VS Code, `mcptools`). Public MCP behavior is
  unchanged.
* New shared tool registry in `R/registry.R`. `chat()`, `serve()`,
  and the CLI all read from `.skill_registry`. No state duplication.
* `cli_worker_spawn()`, `worker_init()`, `worker_dispatch()`,
  `worker_tool_list()`, `cli_worker_drain_events()` exposed with
  `@keywords internal` so the callr session can reach them as
  `corteza::*`.
* Boundary-normalized errors: `corteza_tool_error` condition class
  carries tool name, args, original class, and message across the
  worker pipe.
* Subagents (`R/subagent.R`) also use `callr::r_session` instead of
  spawning `corteza::serve()` children. Same architecture: one
  persistent worker per subagent, direct tool dispatch, no MCP.

## Derived tool schemas

* New `R/schema.R` with `schema_from_fn()` and `register_skill_from_fn()`.
  Tool definitions are derived at runtime from `formals()` and the
  package's `.Rd` files via `tools::Rd_db()`. Replaces 20+
  hand-written `skill_spec(params = list(...))` blocks with one-line
  registrations.
* Type hints come from an R-style `(type)` parenthetical in `@param`
  docs (`(character)`, `(integer)`, `(logical)`, `(character vector)`,
  `(character; one of: a, b, c)` for enums).
* `schema_from_registry()` produces the Anthropic-API-shaped tools
  payload the CLI sends to the model — in the CLI's own process, not
  round-tripped through the worker.
* `inst/tinytest/test_tool_schemas.R` asserts every formal maps to a
  `@param` entry and vice versa. Drift between doc and signature
  fails the test suite.

## Context-aware tool pruning

* `register_skill_from_fn()` accepts an `available` predicate;
  `schema_from_registry()` filters tools whose predicate returns
  `FALSE`. Git tools gate on `.git`; web search gates on
  `TAVILY_API_KEY`. 18-20% fewer tokens in the system prompt for a
  bare environment.

## Handle-based large results

* `tool_run_r()` wraps non-scalar or over-threshold values with
  `with_handle()`. The LLM gets a `str()` summary plus an opaque
  `.h_NNN` handle instead of a flood of printed output.
* New `tool_read_handle(handle, op)` for subsequent inspection
  (`str`, `head`, `summary`, `print`). Handles are addressable by
  name in later `run_r` calls.

## Observability

* Worker emits structured JSON events (`tool_call`, `tool_result`,
  timings) to stderr. CLI drains them between calls.
* New `--trace` flag (and `options(corteza.trace = TRUE)`)
  pretty-prints the events inline via `printify::print_step()` /
  `printify::print_message()`.
* ANSI color detection: `NO_COLOR` honored, `FORCE_COLOR` overrides,
  classic Windows consoles fall back to plain text.

## Platform support

* Windows tested against R 4.5.3 + Rtools45 + Git for Windows.
* The shell tool resolves `bash` to an absolute path (Rtools first,
  Git Bash fallback) so `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe` (the WSL
  launcher stub) cannot intercept commands.
* Fallback `cmd` shell tool when no real bash is found.
* Path validation uses `normalizePath(winslash = "/")` consistently.

## Dependencies

* Added: `callr` (for the worker transport), `printify` (for `--trace`
  rendering).
* Kept: `codetools`, `curl`, `jsonlite`, `llm.api`, `processx`,
  `saber`.
* Suggests: `mx.api`, `tinytest`.
