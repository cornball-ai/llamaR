# The agent's life in chat rooms.
#
# Everything corteza does as a participant rather than as something a
# human is typing at: the long-poll loop, whether to answer, ingesting
# what it does not answer, per-room sessions, the transcript ledger,
# archiving, startup backfill, and the in-room slash commands. R/chat.R
# is the other surface -- a person at a terminal -- and shares nothing
# with this but the agent underneath.
#
# Transport is chat.api's, entirely. This file names no protocol and
# calls no transport package: which one a room is on is a fact about the
# client chat.api hands back, and the only thing here that knows Matrix
# exists is the config that says so. The bot_* functions hard-stop with
# an install hint when chat.api is missing.
#
# chat.api is in Suggests, not Imports. Every call to it in this package
# is behind that guard, so a user who never enables a chat channel
# should not have to install it -- and an Imports entry would make it
# mandatory for everyone.
# Minimum chat.api this corteza can drive, and why each step of it:
#
#   0.0.1.1  chat_poll() starts reporting first_run and the post-sync
#            client. Below it a restart replays its whole backfill.
#   0.0.1.3  chat_matrix() gains e2ee, so building any client at all
#            stops dying on an unused argument, and the adapter can
#            actually encrypt and decrypt -- which is where corteza's
#            E2EE now lives.
#   0.0.1.5  the adapter holds an e2ee client's cursor back in memory as
#            well as on disk when crypto fails. Below it, bot_poll()
#            catching that error and polling the same client again skips
#            the sync whose room keys were lost. And chat_matrix() stops
#            requiring mx.client to build a cleartext client, which
#            matters because bot_chat_client() builds one on every
#            host with the channel configured.
#   0.0.1.6  the crypto cache is keyed on the device identity alone, so
#            one Matrix device cannot end up with two Olm accounts
#            while a process is running.
#   0.0.1.7  init checks the account against the keys the homeserver
#            already holds for the device, which is the half of that
#            invariant surviving a restart.
#   0.0.1.8  that check tells an unverifiable device record from an
#            absent one, instead of publishing over a tampered entry.
#   0.0.1.9  and tells a partial /keys/query from an empty one, so an
#            unreachable server is not read as a device never seen.
#   0.0.1.12 chat_react() and chat_poll()$reactions exist, which is what
#            bot_reaction_approval() drives instead of its own
#            mx_react calls and private mx_sync loop.
#   0.0.1.13 chat_channel_info() and chat_members() exist, which replace
#            this file's direct mx_room_name, mx_room_topic and
#            mx_room_members calls.
#   0.0.1.14 chat_poll()$invites and chat_join() exist, which is what
#            finally makes res$raw unread here.
#   0.0.1.15 chat_whoami() and chat_addressed() exist, and the mention
#            gate reads their answer instead of splitting a Matrix user
#            id on its colon. Below this the poll dies on the missing
#            export -- after the sync has already consumed the cursor,
#            which is the reason this check runs up front.
#   0.0.1.16 the state verbs (chat_channels, chat_history, chat_pending,
#            chat_mark_read) and the credential ones (chat_matrix_config,
#            chat_config_save, chat_matrix_configure, chat_set_identity)
#            exist. This is the version at which corteza stopped calling
#            mx.api and mx.client at all.
#   0.0.1.17 chat_history() pages by an opaque cursor and returns one.
#            Below it the return is a bare list and $messages is NULL,
#            so a restart backfills nothing and says nothing about why.
#   0.0.1.20 chat_edit() exists, takes `rich`, and keeps the message's
#            kind. All three are load-bearing for the activity trail:
#            without the verb it cannot be updated, without rich it
#            cannot be collapsed, and without kind the first edit turns
#            the notice into an ordinary message that other bots answer.
#
# The floor is checked at runtime, not just declared: a Suggests bound is
# a resolution hint, and an installed copy loads however old it is.
#
# Keep this in step with the Suggests bound in DESCRIPTION. There is a
# test that they agree, because they drifted: two bumps were made with a
# sed whose pattern no longer matched, so the constant sat three
# versions behind while the tests asserting it were edited by the same
# non-matching pattern and went on passing.

#' the target room, and writes credentials to
#' \code{tools::R_user_dir("corteza", "config")/matrix.json} with file
#' mode 0600. Call once per host. Model, provider, tools_filter, and
#' auto_approve_asks are defaults the poll loop uses unless overridden
#' at call time.
#'
#' Pre-CRAN releases stored the file at \code{~/.corteza/matrix.json};
#' that path is still read for backward compatibility, but the next
#' \code{bot_configure()} call writes to the new location.
#'
#' @param server Character. Homeserver base URL.
#' @param user Character. Bot localpart or full Matrix ID.
#' @param password Character. Bot password. Stored locally so the bot
#'   can re-authenticate if its access token is invalidated.
#' @param room Character. Room ID or alias the bot should read and post
#'   to. If the bot has been invited but not joined, it will be joined.
#' @param model Character or NULL. Default model name.
#' @param provider Character. LLM provider: "anthropic", "anthropic_claude",
#'   "openai", "openai_codex",
#'   "moonshot", or "ollama".
#' @param tools_filter Character vector or NULL. Passed to
#'   \code{get_tools()} to restrict which tools the bot can invoke.
#'   NULL allows all registered tools.
#' @param auto_approve_asks Logical. When TRUE, tool calls that policy
#'   returns \code{"ask"} for are auto-approved. Suitable for a
#'   personal bot on a trusted tailnet. When FALSE (default) asks are
#'   declined until the thumbs-up reaction protocol lands.
#' @param bots Character vector or NULL. Full Matrix IDs of other known
#'   bot accounts. Their messages only get a reply when they mention
#'   this bot, and they are not counted as humans when deciding whether
#'   a room gets ungated replies (a room whose only non-bot member is
#'   one human is answered without a mention).
#' @param model_badge Character. When to show which model is answering:
#'   \code{"never"} (default, current behavior), \code{"non_default"}
#'   (only while a \code{/model} switch has moved a room session off
#'   the configured default -- silence means the default, a badge means
#'   you are spending something else), or \code{"always"}. When active,
#'   replies get a lightning-bolt first line naming the model and
#'   provider, and the bot renames itself to \code{"<name> <bolt>
#'   <model>"} so every message wears the model in its sender line.
#'   The display name is account-global: with sessions in several
#'   rooms, the most recent switch wins (the per-reply badge line is
#'   always room-accurate).
#' @param display_name Character or NULL. Base display name the badge
#'   rename builds on. Defaults to the localpart of the bot's user id.
#' @param models Character vector or NULL. Extra entries for the
#'   \code{/model} menu, each a \code{"model provider"} pair (e.g.
#'   \code{"claude-sonnet-4-6 anthropic_claude"}; a bare model name
#'   uses the default provider). The menu always lists the configured
#'   default and the live local Ollama inventory; this key adds hosted
#'   models that can't be discovered automatically.
#' @param fallback Character vector or NULL. What \code{\link{turn}}
#'   tries, in order, when the default provider refuses a request with
#'   a limit error (rate, usage, or quota). Same \code{"model provider"}
#'   shape as \code{models}, e.g. \code{c("gpt-5.6-sol openai_codex",
#'   "claude-haiku-4-5 anthropic")}. A provider that hit a limit is
#'   skipped for \code{fallback_cooldown_minutes} (config key, default
#'   30). Set \code{fallback_primary_retry_at} to a weekly boundary such
#'   as \code{"Mon 03:00"} to retry the primary after its account resets.
#'   \code{anthropic_claude} and \code{openai_codex} are subscription
#'   providers; a fallback onto an API-key provider such as \code{anthropic}
#'   or \code{openai} is labeled as billable usage prominently in the reply.
#'   \code{reasoning_effort}, when configured, applies to every candidate.
#'   NULL (default) means a limit error is reported like any other error.

#
# With TRUE, mx.client writes the advanced sync token
# the moment /sync returns, before anything parses the response.
# Persisting it afterwards instead, from chat_poll()'s `cursor`, looks
# equivalent and is not. bot_run() is a bare repeat loop with no
# tryCatch -- it is documented to crash so systemd can restart it, and
# that recovery only works because the restart resumes past the events
# that killed it. Move the write after the parse and one malformed
# event becomes a poison pill: crash, restart, re-sync the same batch,
# crash again, forever.
#
# app is left NULL so mx_sync_update falls through to the wrapped
# config's own attributes, which bot_cfg_object() stamps with corteza's
# path and app. Naming an app here would file corteza's cursor -- and on
# relogin its credentials -- under chat.api's namespace.
#
# e2ee comes off the config, and the adapter owns everything behind it:
# the Olm account, the Megolm sessions, which rooms are encrypted, and
# both directions of the traffic. corteza used to run that itself in
# R/matrix_crypto.R and reach around chat_poll()$raw to decrypt.
#
# No crypto_store either. The adapter derives one per Matrix device --
# (user_id, device_id) off this very config -- and records that identity
# in the store so another device cannot open it. corteza briefly passed
# its own, keyed on user_id alone, which is the right shape for telling
# cornelius and tiny apart and the wrong one for an Olm account: an
# account belongs to a device, so a re-provisioned device_id would have
# reused the old account, and the sanitization was not injective either.
# Naming the store here would only be a second place to get that wrong.
#
# Building a client is cheap even with e2ee on. chat.api interns one
# crypto context per identity, so the account is loaded and its one-time
# keys published once per process no matter how many times this is
# called -- which matters because it is called per use, on purpose, so
# the access token that rotates mid-loop is never read from a stale copy.
#
# `...` reaches the constructor -- for chat_matrix() that means its

# cfg$transport picks the transport. Absent or "matrix" is the Matrix
# adapter, exactly as before. Anything else is a list naming a chat.api
# constructor -- {"constructor": "pkg::fn", "args": {...}} -- and the
